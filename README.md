# Kubernetes the Harder Way

A guide to setting up a production-like Kubernetes cluster on a local machine 
(currently written for macOS & Apple Silicon).

It is written in the spirit, and with inspirations from Kelsey Hightower's [Kubernetes the Hard Way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way), 
and may be considered its lengthier, extended version, optimized for a local deployment.

This repository contains the guide itself, as well as scripts and configuration files that serve as a
reference result of completing the guide. While the guide is written for macOS/ARM64 (Apple Silicon), the scripts
are multi-platform and have been tested on macOS/ARM64 and Ubuntu/AMD64.

## Guidelines for porting the guide to Linux/x86_64

Adapting this guide to the x86_64 CPU architecture requires minor changes:
* changing the QEMU command from `qemu-system-aarch64` to `qemu-system-x86_64`
* changing the OVMF (UEFI) binary from `edk2-aarch64-code.fd` to `edk2-x86_64-code.fd`
* changing the architecture of Ubuntu images from `arm64` to `amd64`
* changing the architecture of Kubernetes, container runtime & CNI binaries from `arm64` to `amd64`

Porting the guide to Linux would require some more work:
* Solving the problem of [QEMU serial console not displaying the login prompt](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/761426/no-login-prompt-in-qemu-serial-console)
* Using different QEMU machine type and hypervisor, i.e. `q35,accel=kvm` instead of `virt,accel=hvf`
* Using different network interface for QEMU VMs, i.e. `tap` backend instead of `vmnet-shared`, with
  manual bridge and NAT setup on the host machine
* Using Linux-specific package manager (e.g. `apt`, `yum`) in place of `homebrew`
* Using Linux-specific commands (e.g. `systemctl`) for restarting services in place of `brew services` and `nfsd`
* Different command for configuring routing on the host machine (`ip route` in place of `route`)
* Minor differences in some commands, e.g. `sed`, `nc`
* Minor differences in some paths, e.g. `dnsmasq` configuration file

All of these changes have already been included into reference scripts and tested on Ubuntu/AMD64.
While it is fine for scripts to be multi-platform, the text of the guide would become extremely unwieldy if it
tried to cover more than one platform. Therefore, a completely separate version is necessary for Linux.
